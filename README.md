# Worn Out: E-Commerce Service
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description
Given the importance and prevalence of internet retail, businesses will need a service that can track and manage data on the backend of their applications. Worn-Out: E-Commerce Service is a backend application that allows the user to store, track, and add to an internet retail database. This project utilizes JavaScript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), and [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/api/v6/). As this project is meant to demonstrate my ability to use the aforementioned programming languages and npm packages, the database is quite small.
